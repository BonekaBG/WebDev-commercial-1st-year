ChatGPT was used quite often for many code corrections or translations so that it would work properly. I can give 20-30% to ChatGPT for the functionality of the website for correcting my mistakes, both spelling and coding mistakes.

Design was all my idea

https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp   for HTML help and learning

https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp    for php help plus learning, and your powerpoint on PHP too

https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp    for CSS. I basically found one format and just copy pasted it and then changed it to match the content

https://onlinephp.io/   for PHP testing

https://fontawesome.com/v4/get-started/     Font Awesome for the icons 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihTB-aZ-Msk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nJN12cHyv8  these 2 youtube videos for teaching me how to use font awesome icons and styling

although

styling didnt work in css so i basically did the normal css style and transfered it into inline, so you might see in the CSS file some repearting code that you have noticed in the html files

https://validator.w3.org/    HTML validator to verify my code is okay and running
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/     this one is for CSS
